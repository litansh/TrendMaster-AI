The error messages indicate that the Prophet library is failing to build, specifically when attempting to import numpy during the build process, despite numpy being listed in your requirements. This type of error can occur due to several reasons, including the order of package installations, issues with the Python environment in the Docker container, or other package conflicts.

Here are a series of steps to try and resolve this issue:

1. Ensure Correct Order of Installation
Ensure that numpy and other dependencies that need to be installed before prophet are listed before prophet in the requirements.txt file. Your requirements.txt should look like this:

makefile
Copy code
numpy==1.23.1
pandas==1.2.3
pyyaml==5.4.1
holidays==0.10.3
requests==2.25.1
openai==0.10.2
pymeeus==0.5.12  # if required, specify the version
pystan==2.19.1.1  # Prophet dependency that might need explicit installation
prophet==1.0
2. Install Dependencies Sequentially
Modify your Dockerfile to install critical Python packages individually to isolate the issue:

dockerfile
Copy code
FROM python:3.9-slim

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    python3-dev \
    libgfortran5 \
    libatlas-base-dev \
    libsodium-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt /tmp/

# Upgrade pip and install packages individually
